# IAM Service
IAM is a platform by which you can manage any AWS account and can create different type of account under a root account and can give different permissions to IAM users.
We can create differrent groups like Admin, Developer and Tester and assign a specific permissions to that user group and we can create a new user and can put user in any one or multiple groups.
For application and service, We need to create a new IAM user on behalf of application and user and need to create a rule policy and need to assign this created IAM user.
